# TheEpicStudent/WallpaperCreator

A website I created to help people create custom wallpapers for their phones without downloading any apps or seeing any ads.
If you wanna see it, just go to [the website](www.wallpapercreator.me).
If you're a weirdo and wanna run it on your machine, just go ahead and do
```
npm install express http path prompt-sync && node server.js
```
and youll be able to access it at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

I wish you well making wallpapers for your phones
